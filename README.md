***It is a sql project to analyze the world population in 2020 and 2023.***
SQL is a very important skills for analyzing the data and having good knowledge in SQL will help any data enthusiast to start career as data analyst. In this project I have used some of the important concepts of SQL like join, group by, where, cte, aggregate function like SUM, subquery etc.
This repository contains different projects/datasets to give the user many opportunities to practice:
•	Basic select statements (select, where, group by, having).  
•	Aggregate functions (count, sum, min, max, avg)  
•	Joins  
•	CTE's  
•	Window functions (rank, row_number )
